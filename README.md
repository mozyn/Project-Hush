Encrypt and save your passwords safely and securely! Project Hush takes your extremely long (or short!), secure generated (or not!) passwords and encrypts them using our custom algorithm (not hashing!) and saves the result to a QR Code to be stored and decrypted later! Encryption and decryption methods are exclusive and personal to users by using their birth month and day as values within the encryption/decryption formula, adding an extra layer of security. 

Project Hush features: 
- Encryption of user passwords
- Decryption of user passwords
- Exporting to QR Code
- Importing and Decrypting QR Code
